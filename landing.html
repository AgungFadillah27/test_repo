        <li><a href="">Hi shafa, How are you today? You know, i feel good lately, maybe it's because i can be with you again..
            You know, even since we breakup, i always feel how guilty i am, 
            And then 3 years pass, I still can't forget what i have done to you.
            
            All i can say is I deeply apologize, and thanks for give me the chance to stay with you again :)
            
            I love everything about you :)
            Your Smile
            Your Laugh
            Your Weird Jokes
            
            Even when the world turns it back on you, I will always be by your side.
            I don't care what people say about you, I don't care about the past that you've been through.
            
            All i care is, I can be with you again, We can be couple like we were used to :)
            
            I love you, Now, And Forever :)
